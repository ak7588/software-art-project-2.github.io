        <p> The next few years will be filled with stress and getting things done. You will need to make time for friends, family, and writing. Do you have a goal? Do you have a plan? Do you have a plan B? Do you have a plan C? </p>
        <p> You are going to grow. The first thing you will need to do is figure out who you are. Do you want to be a doctor? An accountant? A lawyer? A teacher? An artist? A mom? A dad? </p>
        <p> You will want to make the most of each day. How many of the things you get done do you really need? Do you really need to do more? Do you really need to live? Do you really need to work? </p>
        <p> You might wonder how you will get to a million dollars but don't worry, you're not alone. More than 20,000 people have pledged to make it to 1 million dollars in just 10 months. So what does this mean for you? It means you can work and be happy. You can go on vacation or spend time with your family. You can join a club or a club can join you. </p>
        <p> And you can start a business or start a business can join you. If you're working a regular job or even if you're not, you'll be ok. If you're not working at all, then you're probably doing something wrong. You're going to get there, and you're going to get there quickly. One day you might even start your own business. </p>
